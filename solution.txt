Description:
This function generates all consecutive substrings from a given input string. 
It uses two nested loops: the outer loop selects the starting character, 
and the inner loop slices the string to generate substrings that start from that character.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. 
This is because for each character, we may generate up to n substrings.

Scalability:
As the input string becomes longer, the number of substrings grows quadratically.
This means if the input size doubles, the number of substrings roughly quadruples.
The nested loops are the main factor affecting scalability.
